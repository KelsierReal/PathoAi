# Predefined mappings for 10 slides with detailed fake results

    'slide1': """
Diagnosis: Plasmodium Falciparum Detected
Confidence: 92%
Severity: High
Explanation: The AI model identified characteristic ring forms and gametocytes, indicative of Plasmodium Falciparum, the most severe malaria parasite causing complications like cerebral malaria.
Recommendations: Immediate initiation of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). Hospitalization recommended for severe symptoms. Consult a specialist.
""",
    'slide2': """
Diagnosis: Plasmodium Vivax Detected
Confidence: 87%
Severity: Moderate
Explanation: Enlarged red blood cells with Sch√ºffner's dots and trophozoites observed, typical of Plasmodium Vivax, which can cause relapsing malaria due to liver hypnozoites.
Recommendations: Administer chloroquine followed by primaquine to clear liver stages. Monitor for relapse over 6-12 months.
""",
    'slide3': """
Diagnosis: No Malaria Detected
Confidence: 95%
Status: Clear
Explanation: Blood smear shows normal erythrocytes with no parasitic forms. No evidence of malaria infection.
Recommendations: Maintain mosquito prevention (nets, repellents). Retest if symptoms persist.
""",
    'slide4': """
Diagnosis: Plasmodium Ovale Detected
Confidence: 89%
Severity: Low to Moderate
Explanation: Oval-shaped infected cells with James' dots detected, characteristic of Plasmodium Ovale, a less common relapsing malaria species.
Recommendations: Chloroquine treatment followed by primaquine. Schedule follow-up to monitor for relapses.
""",
    'slide5': """
Diagnosis: Plasmodium Malariae Detected
Confidence: 91%
Severity: Moderate
Explanation: Band forms and rosette schizonts identified, typical of Plasmodium Malariae, which may lead to chronic infections with quartan fever cycles.
Recommendations: Chloroquine or ACT. Monitor kidney function due to potential nephrotic syndrome.
""",
    'slide6': """
Diagnosis: Mixed Infection (Falciparum + Vivax)
Confidence: 85%
Severity: High
Explanation: Both Falciparum ring forms and Vivax trophozoites detected, indicating a complex mixed infection requiring aggressive treatment.
Recommendations: Broad-spectrum ACT. Urgent hospital evaluation to manage complications.
""",
    'slide7': """
Diagnosis: No Malaria Detected, Artifacts Noted
Confidence: 93%
Status: Clear with Notes
Explanation: Staining artifacts mimicking parasites observed, but no confirmed infection. Erythrocytes appear normal.
Recommendations: Ensure clean slide preparation and retest if symptoms persist.
""",
    'slide8': """
Diagnosis: Plasmodium Knowlesi Detected
Confidence: 88%
Severity: Variable (Potentially High)
Explanation: Banana-shaped gametocytes and rapid replication cycles detected, consistent with Plasmodium Knowlesi, a zoonotic malaria prevalent in Southeast Asia.
Recommendations: ACT treatment. Notify health authorities in endemic regions.
""",
    'slide9': """
Diagnosis: Suspected Malaria, Indeterminate Species
Confidence: 80%
Severity: Unknown
Explanation: Parasitic forms present, but poor slide quality prevents species identification. General malaria features like ring forms observed.
Recommendations: Retest with a high-quality sample. Consider empirical antimalarial treatment if clinically indicated.
""",
    'slide10': """
Diagnosis: No Malaria Detected, Healthy Sample
Confidence: 98%
Status: Clear
Explanation: Pristine blood smear with healthy erythrocytes and no parasitic elements, indicating no malaria infection.
Recommendations: Continue preventive measures. Annual screening in endemic areas.
